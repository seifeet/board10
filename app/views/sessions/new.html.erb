Are you going to a school or your kids are? If yes, then great! Our site is for you. If not, then we would like to put a school in your life again with a little different approach. Our site is designed to make a school in your neighborhood as a focal point of your interests, meetings, events, news and much more. All you need is to create a profile and link it to a school or schools in your area. As soon as you do that all public news related to the linked schools will flow to your homepage instantly. There is no need to search for friends to be a part of your neighborhood. Just add your school!<br />
How do you get all these news? Who share them? Simple! It is you and your neighbors. We give you Boards to write what is going on. You can create your own board or boards according to your interests and goals. Please link your newly created board to your local school from your profile. In this way all you share will flow to your neighbors.<br />
One more thing! You are not along with your boards. You just became their owner. Other people can join your boards with your permission. They will become members of your board and will be able to post on your board too.<br />
And the last note, but not least, is about your privacy. Our boards as well as posts on them can be public or private. You can create a public board, but you always have an option to post privately. In this case only members of your board will be able to see you private messages. The other way around with a private board and public posts works too! You are the boss after all.<br />
We believe that now is the time to switch from a social network where you straggle to find connections and friends into a community network where community finds you and you become a part of it. It is time to upgrade!<br /><br />

So, welcome aboard!<br /><br />

Sincerely,<br />
Boardten team
